# MOTIVATION
- Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
- Composition lets us make compound objects
  - E.g. a methematical expression composed of single expressions
  - A grouping of shapres that consists of several shapes

- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformely
  - i.e, Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs

# COMPOSITE
A mechanism of threating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of ibjects in a uniform manner
