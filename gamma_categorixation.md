# Creational Patters
  - deal with the creation (construction) of objects
  - Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step) 


# Structural Patterns
  - concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
  - many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
  - Stress the importance of good API design


# Behavioral Patterns
  - they are all different; no central theme (solve a particular problem)
